## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability within the app, please report it to us.
You may do so anonymously, or we can credit you for your findings if you wish.

The best way to report any vulnerability or security issue is to email us at [contact@unsearch.app](mailto:contact@unsearch.app).

We kindly ask that you:

- Refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we've had a chance to address it.
- Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.
