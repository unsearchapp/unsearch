Unsearch is a cross-browser manager for browsing data. It helps you access your bookmarks, tabs, and search history from anywhere
by syncing all your browsers.

To use Unsearch, install the Unsearch extension on your browser. Once the extension is installed and you log in to your account, Unsearch
will start syncing your bookmarks, tabs, and search history. You can then access all your data through the Unsearch web app.

The web app allows you to manage your data easily. You can edit, delete, create, and download your bookmarks, tabs, and search history,
giving you complete control over your browsing data.
