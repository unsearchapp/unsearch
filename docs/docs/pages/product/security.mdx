# Security

Unsearch is currently in its alpha phase and we're focusing on enhancing its security:

- **Code Audit:**
  A thorough code audit is planned but not yet completed.

- **Database Encryption:** All sensitive data stored in our database is currently encrypted at rest. End-to-end encryption planned but not yet completed.

- **Data Privacy:** No file information is shared outside of the Unsearch web app and browser extensions. All interactions with
  your data are confined to these environments.
