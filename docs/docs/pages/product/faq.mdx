### What is Unsearch?

Unsearch is a cross-browser manager for browsing data. It allows you to sync, manage, and search your bookmarks, tabs, and search history from
any browser, all in one place.

### Can I use Unsearch?

Yes, Unsearch is available for everyone. You can either [self-host](/developers/self-host) it for free or use [our cloud version](https://unsearch.app).
The cloud version provides a hassle-free experience without the need to set up and maintain your own infrastructure.

### How does it work?

Unsearch uses WebSockets to sync data between your browser extensions and the dashboard. This bidirectional communication allows
you to manage your bookmarks, tabs, and search history even when your browser extensions are offline. Once the extensions are back online, any
changes made are automatically synced.

### Who is this for?

Unsearch is designed for anyone who wants a safe and simple solution to manage browsing data across multiple browsers. Itâ€™s especially useful
for users who work across different devices or browsers and want a seamless way to access and control their bookmarks, tabs, and search history
from anywhere.

### Where is my data stored?

Your data is stored in a database located in the EU. All sensitive data, such as bookmarks and search history, is encrypted to ensure privacy and
security. We do not sell or share your data with third parties, and you can delete all your data at any time through the dashboard.

### What makes Unsearch different from Chrome Sync or Firefox Sync?

Unlike Chrome Sync or Firefox Sync, which only work within their respective browsers, Unsearch allows you to sync and manage data across multiple
browsers. It provides a unified dashboard for easy access and management of your browsing data, regardless of the browser you use.

### How does Unsearch make money?

Unsearch is a fully open-source project, and the self-hosted version is available for free. We make money by offering a paid cloud version of the
service, which provides additional convenience for those who prefer not to manage their own infrastructure.

### What is the tech stack of Unsearch?

Unsearch is built with [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/).
