# Self-host Unsearch

If you prefer to self-host Unsearch, follow these steps to get up and running. You will need the following:

- **Ubuntu**: Minimum recommended version is 22.04.
- **PostgreSQL**: Minimum recommended version is 13.
- **Domain**: Required so you can connect from multiple devices.

Make sure you have these services set up before proceeding with the installation.

## 1. SSH into your server and clone the repository

Begin by accessing your machine via SSH. Once connected, clone the Unsearch repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unsearchapp/unsearch.git
```

## 2. Create a `.env` file

In the root directory of the cloned repository, create a .env file. This file will hold the environment variables needed to configure Unsearch.
Here's the list of required and optional environment variables, along with example values:

```yaml
SELF_HOSTED=true
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=unsearch
PGUSER=your_pg_user
PGPASSWORD=your_pg_password
PG_SECRET_KEY=your_pg_secret_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
APP_URL=https://dashboard.mydomain.com
WORD2VEC_URL=https://dashboard.mydomain.com
```

Required Environment Variables:

- `SELF_HOSTED`: Disables the payments integration. Set this to `true`.

- `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`: These are the PostgreSQL connection details.

```bash
# Example:
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=unsearch
PGUSER=your_pg_user
PGPASSWORD=your_pg_password
```

- `PG_SECRET_KEY`: Used to encrypt sensitive data in PostgreSQL.

- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for generating JWT tokens.

- `APP_URL`: The URL of the backend without trailing `/`.(\*)

- `WORD2VEC_URL`: The URL of the word embedding API without trailing `/`.(\*)

Optional Environment Variables:

- `LOG_LEVEL`: Controls the logging verbosity. Default is `info`. Valid values: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` and `fatal`.
- `WEBAPP_URL`: Optional, required for payments and password reset.
  This is the url of the web app without trailing `/`, for example (`https://dashboard.mydomain.com`)(\*)
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `EMAIL_FROM`: Required for sending password reset links.

```bash
# Example:
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=youremail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=yourpassword
EMAIL_FROM=youremail@gmail.com
```

::::warning
(\*) In this guide, all services are hosted on the same machine and share the same URL. However, this setup might change in the future.

## 3. Install Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Install Docker Compose by following the instructions
on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

For convenience, here is a summary of the commands to install Docker Compose on Ubuntu:

1. Set up Docker's `apt` repository.

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the Docker packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

## 4. Update Your Domain DNS

To ensure your subdomains point to the correct machine, update the DNS records for your domain as follows:

1. **A Record** for dashboard:

- **Name**: dashboard
- **Content**: The public IP address of your machine.

2. **A Record** for ws:
- **Name**: ws
- **Content**: The public IP address of your machine.

These records will link both `dashboard.mydomain.com` and `ws.mydomain.com` to your server's IP address.



## 5. Install Let's Encrypt and Add SSL to Domains

To secure your domain with SSL, you’ll need to use Let's Encrypt. 
Follow these steps to install Certbot and obtain an SSL certificate:

1. Install `snapd`:

```bash
sudo apt install snapd
```

2. Install Certbot using `snapd`:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```

3. Obtain an SSL Certificate:
   Replace `mydomain.com` with your actual domain name and run:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d dashboard.mydomain.com
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d ws.mydomain.com
```

This commands will request an SSL certificate for both `dashboard.mydomain.com` and `ws.mydomain.com`

4. Configure Automatic Renewal:

Certbot automatically sets up a cron job to renew your certificates. You can verify the renewal process with:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

## 6. Setup nginx

At the root of the repository, start by copying the example Nginx configuration file:

```
cp nginx.example.conf nginx.conf
```

This command creates a new `nginx.conf` file with default values. 
You’ll need to edit this file to configure Nginx for your domain:

Open `nginx.conf` in your preferred text editor (e.g., vim):

```bash
vim nginx.conf
```
Replace every occurrence of `example.com` with your actual domain name.

This configuration will set up SSL for `dashboard.mydomain.com`, redirect requests to your webapp and backend, and handle WebSocket connections for `ws.mydomain.com`.

Make sure to review and adjust any other settings in nginx.conf as needed for your specific setup.

## 7. Start services

To start all the services, run the following command at the root of the repository:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This command will start your Docker containers in detached mode.

Once the services are up and running, you can exit the machine.

## 8. Build the extensions

Now you can build the extensions and connect them to your domain. 
On your local machine, clone the repository again to build the extensions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unsearchapp/unsearch.git
```

Then create an `.env` file at the root of the repository with the following values, 
substituting mydomain.com for your actual domain:

```bash
VITE_WEBAPP_URL=https://dashboard.mydomain.com
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://dashboard.mydomain.com
VITE_WS_URL=wss://ws.mydomain.com
```

Before building, install all required packages:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the following command to build the extensions:

```
pnpm --filter extension build
```

The extensions are now built and ready to use. You can find them at:

- `/extension/dist/chrome`: Chrome extension (should work on any Chromium-based browser)
- `/extension/dist/edge`: Edge extension
- `/extension/dist/firefox`: Firefox extension

::::info
They are unpacked; you can create a `.zip` file with all of their contents if needed.
